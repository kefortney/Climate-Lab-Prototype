  <h1>Empower &amp; Enact</h1>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Grow food agency—your confidence, skills, and ability to make choices that fit your context and values. You’ll apply inquiry‑based methods to turn sustainability ideas into everyday actions.</p>
  <h2>Learn &amp; Try</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete a food‑agency self‑assessment (repeat over time to see growth).</li>
    <li>Do a “recipe reshuffle” to adapt a familiar dish to be more plant‑forward, lower‑waste, or locally sourced.</li>
    <li>Cook, reflect, revise: make a recipe, capture what worked, and iterate.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Short video</h2>
  <div class="video placeholder">Embed video: Empower &amp; Enact (placeholder)</div>
  <h2>Go deeper</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recipe analysis &amp; development</li>
    <li>Culinary medicine &amp; behavior change</li>
    <li>Full‑cycle cooking (from procurement to leftovers)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Why We Explore Food Agency</h2>
  <p>We want to explore what it takes to cook a meal and make it taste good. What technical skills, knowledge, and outside factors influence the practice of procuring, preparing and eating food? This will be done through your own personal development of the skills that would be necessary to move from the aspirations articulated and the actions required to make everyday meals, known as <strong>food agency</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Food agency is a concept and a practice that seeks to create the means for sustainable behavior change. Food agency is an organizing philosophy and practice that can be useful for you as an individual cook and also for the facilitation of classes and interventions. Along the way, we will highlight key cooking techniques, food science, and sensory considerations that can help you transform the hypothetical ingredients of a diet for personal and planetary health into a real meal you can eat and enjoy. This week, you will apply some of these skills to make (and eat) your first meal for the class, a salad.</p>
  
  <h2>Learning Through Cooking Sessions</h2>
  <p>Each session you will learn about and apply key organization skills, cooking techniques, and sensory considerations that can help you transform the aspirations connected to making meals that integrate personal and planetary health into a real meal you can eat and enjoy. These skills, techniques and considerations will build upon each other, so that once you have completed all the sessions you will have a large toolkit to use in your personal and professional life.</p>
